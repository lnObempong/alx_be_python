# ALX Backend Python Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts developed as part of the **ALX Backend Specialization**. The goal is to practice core Python concepts such as variable assignment, arithmetic operations, user input, and basic logic.

---

## ðŸ“œ Project Descriptions

### 1. `basic_operations.py`
Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two predefined numbers.

> **Concepts**: Arithmetic, variable assignment, formatted strings

### 2. `simple_interest.py`
Calculates simple interest on a principal amount over time.

> **Formula**: `Interest = Principal Ã— Rate Ã— Time`  
> **Concepts**: Math formulas, variables

### 3. `rectangle_area.py`
Computes the area of a rectangle from predefined length and width.

> **Formula**: `Area = Length Ã— Width`  
> **Concepts**: Arithmetic operations

### 4. `hours_to_seconds.py`
Converts a number of hours to seconds.

> **Conversion**: `1 hour = 3600 seconds`  
> **Concepts**: Multiplication, units conversion

### 5. `future_age_calculator.py`
Takes user input for current age and calculates how old theyâ€™ll be in the year 2050.

> **Concepts**: User input, type casting, arithmetic

### 6. `finance_calculator.py`
Takes user input for income and expenses, calculates monthly savings, and projects annual savings with a fixed 5% interest.

> **Formula**:  
> `Annual Savings = (Monthly Income - Expenses) * 12`  
> `Projected = Annual Savings + (Annual Savings * 0.05)`  
> **Concepts**: Input/output, math, variables, no conditionals
